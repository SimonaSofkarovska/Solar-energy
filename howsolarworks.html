<h2>Solar panels </h2>
<p> The type we're talking about is photovoltaic solar panels – also known as solar PV – which catch the sun's energy and convert it into electricity that can be used to power household goods and lighting. The other type is solar thermal, which allows you to heat water and can cut down heating bills. To maximize what your panels can make, you usually need a predominantly south-facing roof. If your roof faces south-west or west you'll still get some benefit, but it may be less effective and you might not get the maximum savings.</p>

<h2>Charge controller </h2>
<p>A solar charge controller manages the power going into the battery bank from the solar array.  It ensures that the deep cycle batteries are not overcharged during the day and that the power doesn’t run back to the solar panels overnight and drain the batteries. Some charge controllers are available with additional capabilities, like lighting and load control, but managing the power is its primary job. A solar charge controller is available in two different technologies, PWM and MPPT. How they perform in a system is very different from each other.</p>

<h2>Battery system </h2>
<p>Battery size or capacity is measured in kWh. This is the amount of energy a battery can store, although the usable capacity may differ from the total battery capacity. For example, a lithium battery with 10kWh total capacity may have its usable capacity limited to 80% to increase lifespan. Therefore, only the 8kWh of energy can be discharged on a daily basis. However, often the last 20% is available in emergencies, such as a prolonged blackout. The life of a battery is generally determined by the number of charge/discharge cycles. All batteries lose capacity over time, typically after 3000-3500 cycles(9-12years).</p>

<h2>DC power </h2>
<p>Direct current(DC) electricity is what solar panels produce and what batteries hold in storage. If the batteries are DC-coupled, they can share the inverter with the solar panels, while if they are AC-coupled, they’ll require a separate inverter. A DC-connected energy storage system connects to the grid mains at the same place as the solar panels; this means that they share a ‘hybrid’ inverter. You can think of this as a ‘one box’ solution because there is only one inverter. Because they contain fewer components, DC-coupled systems are recommended for homes considering a brand new solar & storage system.</p>

<h2>Inverter </h2>
<p>The basic function of an inverter is to convert the direct current(DC) power that solar panels create to alternating current(AC) power that is usable in homes and businesses or fed directly into the grid in front-of-the-meter projects (utility-scale solar arrays). Solar inverters are the hardest-working component of a solar array. Inverters are responsible for continuously tracking the solar array’s voltage to identify the maximum power at which the modules can operate. They make it possible for solar owners to keep track of the power output of their solar systems. Most inverters have communications capabilities via hardwired ethernet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi.</p>

<h2>AC power </h2>
<p>The AC power systems require an additional inverter circuit so as to convert the DC power into usable single or 3 phase AC power. Solar AC power systems are primarily of 2 types. First is a Battery-based or hybrid solar power system. These systems convert the solar power into AC but also have an additional battery to act as a storage medium. The second one is an on-grid and batteryless system. Such systems directly convert in real-time basis all the solar power into AC, but do not have any battery and hence can not store the solar power generated.</p>
